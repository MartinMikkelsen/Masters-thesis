\section{Interaction of Radiation with Matter}\label{RadMatter}
In the following, we will derive the necessary equations describing how a quantised vector field interacts with matter within the framework of the second quantisation. We will assume the final quantised form of the vector potential \cite{QOptic,KerneII} given by
\begin{equation} \label{quantised}
	\vec{A}(\vec{r},t) = \sum_{\vec{k},\lambda} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi\hbar c^2}{\omega_{\vec{k}} V}} \bigg(a_{\vec{k},\lambda}\vec{e}_{\vec{k},\lambda}\text{e}^{i(\vec{k}\cdot \vec{r})-i\omega_k t}+a_{\vec{k,\lambda}}^\dagger\vec{e}_{\vec{k},\lambda}^*\text{e}^{-i(\vec{k}\cdot \vec{r})+i\omega_k t}\bigg),
\end{equation}
where $\vec{k}$ is a wave vector related to the frequency by the dispersion law $\omega=ck$ and the wave polarisation is described by $\vec{e}_{\vec{k},\lambda}$. The operators $a_{\vec{k},\lambda}$ and $a_{\vec{k},\lambda}^\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators, respectively. The normalisation of these operators yields the factor in front. 

We now consider a non-relativistic system of charged particles interacting with the electromagnetic field. In this thesis, we will consider a two-particle system, but in this section, we generalise the results to any number of particles denoted by the subscript $i$. The interaction will enable the system to emit and absorb photons. We start with the Hamiltonian describing the many-body system given by $H_0(\vec{r}_i,\vec{p}_i)$ with no field, where $\vec{r}_i$ and $\vec{p}_i$ is the position and momentum of the $i$'th particle, respectively. We introduce a field and do the following gauge transform 
\begin{equation} \label{substi}
	\vec{p}_i \rightarrow \vec{p}_i - \frac{e_i}{c}\vec{A}(\vec{r}_i),
\end{equation}
where $e_i$ is the charge of the $i$'th particle. This leads to a new Hamiltonian, which now depends on the field variables
\begin{equation} \label{withfield}
	H_0 \rightarrow H_0' = H_0 \left( \vec{r}_i,\vec{p}_i-\frac{e_i}{c}\vec{A}(\vec{r}_i)\right) + \sum_i e_i \phi(\vec{r}_i),
\end{equation}
where the last term in equation \eqref{withfield} is the potential energy. We now introduce the radiation gauge choice, which is purely conventional and any other choice of gauge will result in the same equations, albeit more difficult. The radiation gauge \cite{Jackson} is given by 
\begin{equation} \label{RadiationGauge}
	\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{A} = \phi = 0,
\end{equation}
and the non-relativistic Hamiltonian of the system describing the interaction with the radiation field is given by
\begin{equation} \label{Rad}
	H = \sum_i \frac{1}{2m_i}\left( \vec{p}-\frac{e_i}{c}\vec{A}(\vec{r}_i)\right)^2,
\end{equation}
where $\vec{A}(\vec{r}_i)$ is equation \eqref{quantised} at point $\vec{r}_i$ and $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$'th particle. We assumed the interaction between particles depends on their coordinates, so the minimal inclusion of the electromagnetic field affects only the kinetic part. This is a fair approximation in the non-relativistic limit and does not account for velocity-dependant interactions such as spin-orbit.
The electromagnetic interaction is relatively weak, and its strength is given by the fine structure constant, $\alpha = e^2/(\hbar c)$. Generally speaking, this interaction can be taken into account in the lowest non-vanishing order of perturbation theory. We expand \eqref{Rad} and keep only the linear terms
\begin{equation} \label{RadLin}
	H^{(1)} = -\sum_i \frac{e_i}{2m_i c} (\vec{p}_i\cdot \vec{A}(\vec{r}_i)+\vec{A}(\vec{r}_i)\cdot \vec{p}_i),
\end{equation}
where the $(1)$ represents the first non-vanishing order. Due to our choice of gauge equation \eqref{RadiationGauge} the two terms in \eqref{RadLin} commute and we are left with
\begin{equation} \label{RadiationHamil}
	H^{(1)} = - \sum_i \frac{e_i}{m_i c} \vec{A}(\vec{r}_i,t)\cdot\vec{p}_i.
\end{equation}
For the type of problems we will be solving in chapter \ref{sec:PionPhotoproduction}, we will be working mainly with a single charged particle, and we can ignore the sum in \eqref{RadiationHamil}.
\section{Density of States}\label{sec:densityofstates}
As mentioned in section \ref{RadMatter}, the electromagnetic interaction strength is related to the fine structure constant. In chapter \ref{sec:PionPhotoproduction}, we want to do perturbation theory to get an expression for the total cross-section as a function of energy which the relatively weak fine structure constant allows. From perturbation theory, the transition rate is described by Fermi's golden rule given by
\begin{equation} \label{FermiGolden}
	\text{d}\omega = \frac{2\pi}{\hbar}\abs{\mathcal{M}}^2 \rho,
\end{equation}
where the matrix element $\mathcal{M}$ is the subject of chapter \ref{sec:PionPhotoproduction} and $\text{d}\rho$ is the density of states after the interaction. In this section, we will derive general results of the density of states in the non-relativistic and relativistic limits. The density of states is defined by
\begin{marginfigure}
	\centering
	\input{Figures/diffcros}
	\caption{Differential cross section and the solid angle $\Omega_q$ (red cone).}
	\label{fig:diffcross}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{equation} \label{DensityOfStates}
	\rho(E) = \frac{\text{d}n(E)}{\text{d}E},
\end{equation}
where $n(E)$ is the number of states with energy $E$. Consider the number of states within the momentum space volume
\begin{equation} \label{momspace}
	\text{d}^3\vec{p} = p^2 \text{d}p \, \text{d}\Omega_q,
\end{equation}
where the subscript $q$ is used to emphasize momentum space. We will use this notation throughout the thesis\footnote{We will write the momentum as $\hbar \vec{q}$, where $\vec{q}$ is a wave number in chapter \ref{sec:PionPhotoproduction} so to keep the notation consistent we also use $q$ here. }. Equation \eqref{momspace} corresponds to the momenta with magnitude from $p$ to $p+\text{d}p$ and within a cone of solid angle $\text{d}\Omega_q$. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:diffcross}. We use the solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for a particle confined in a large volume with periodic boundary conditions are travelling waves \cite{Kernebog}. This leads to the following expression
\begin{equation} \label{densityrho}
	\rho(p) \, \text{d}\rho = \left( \frac{L}{2\pi\hbar}\right)^3 \text{d}^3 \vec{p} = \frac{V}{(2\pi\hbar)^3} p^2 \, \text{d}p \, \text{d}\Omega_q.
\end{equation}
In chapter \ref{sec:PionPhotoproduction}, we are interested in the number of possible final states with energy in the range between $E_f$ and $E_f + \text{d}E_f$ so we express \eqref{densityrho} in terms of energy, where the subscript $f$ denotes final state. This is given by \cite{Kernebog}
\begin{equation} \label{densityenergy}
	\rho(E_f) = \frac{V p_f^2}{(2\pi \hbar)^3} \frac{\text{d}p_f}{\text{d}E_f} \, \text{d}\Omega_q.
\end{equation}
This is the final non-relativistic expression. However, we want to generalise this result to account for relativistic effects. For a general pion photoproduction process, we can write
\begin{equation} \label{twobody}
	N + \gamma \rightarrow N+\pi,
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the nucleon and $\gamma$ is a photon. The final state energy \cite{Kernebog} is then given by
\begin{equation} \label{Ef}
	E_f = E_N + E_\pi = \sqrt{p_f^2 c^2 +m_N^2c^4} + \sqrt{p_f^2c^2 + m^2_\pi c^4}.
\end{equation}
We now change the notation to match the variables used later in chapter \ref{sec:PionPhotoproduction} and write the final state momentum $p_f$ in terms of the pion-nucleon wave number $q$. That is, $\vec{p}\rightarrow \hbar \vec{q}$. 

From conservation of energy, we get the following expression for the energy of the relative pion-nucleon motion denoted $E_q$ in the center of mass. 
\begin{equation} \label{Eq}
	E_q = \sqrt{m_N^2 c^4+(\hbar c)^2q^2} + \sqrt{m_\pi c^4+(\hbar c)^2 q^2}-m_N c^2-m_\pi c^2.
\end{equation}
Examining \eqref{densityenergy}, we want an expression for the final state momentum in terms of the wave number. The density of states around $\vec{q}$ is given by
\begin{equation} \label{DensityEQ}
	\rho_f = \frac{Vq}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{2}\frac{\text{d}q^2}{\text{d}E_q} \text{d}\Omega_q.
\end{equation}
We now solve for $(\hbar c)^2q^2$ in \eqref{Eq}, which yields the following result\footnote{It is also possible to use the approximation that $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\simeq 0.96x+0.4y$ yielding an error of only $4\%$.}
\begin{equation} \label{hbarc-q}
	(\hbar c)^2 q^2 = \frac{E_q(E_q+2m_N c^2)(E_q+2m\pi c^2)(E_q+2m_N c^2+2m_\pi c^2)}{4(E_q+m_N c^2+m_\pi c^2)^2},
\end{equation}
and we are now able to calculate the derivative of equation \eqref{hbarc-q}
\begin{equation}\begin{split} \label{derivative}
		(\hbar c)^2\frac{\text{d}q^2}{\text{d}E_q} &= \frac{(E_q^2+2E_q m_N c^2+2m_N^2 c^4+2E_q m_\pi c^2+2m_N m_\pi c^4)}{2(E_q+m_N c^2+m_\pi c^2)^3} \\
		& \, \times (E_q^2+2E_q m_N c^2 +2m_\pi^2 c^4 +2E_q m_\pi c^2+2m_N m_\pi c^4),
	\end{split}
\end{equation} 
which yields the final expression for the relativistic density of states by substituting equation \eqref{derivative} into equation \eqref{DensityEQ}. Non-relativistically, the density of states in terms of $E_q$ and $q$ is given by the following 
\begin{equation}\label{nonreladensity}
	\text{d}\rho_f = \frac{Vq\mu_{N\pi}}{(2\pi)^3\hbar^2} \text{d}\,\Omega_q,
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{N\pi}$ is the reduced mass of the pion-nucleon system. We now have two expressions for the density of states to use in conjunction with equation \eqref{FermiGolden}. In chapter \ref{sec:PionPhotoproduction}, we will refer to equation \eqref{derivative} as the relativistic density of states and equation \eqref{nonreladensity} as the non-relativistic density of states.
