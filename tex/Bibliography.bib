From this, using results for the photon total cross section, obtained previously with the same apparatus, the neutron total cross section has been determined in the resonance region. The resonant structure is found to be quite different from that for the proton. Thereafter the neutron cross section falls off steadily with energy, and the values obtained are consistently lower than those for the proton. Forward scattering amplitudes have been evaluated for the deuteron.}
