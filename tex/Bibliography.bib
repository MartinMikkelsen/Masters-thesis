From this, using results for the photon total cross section, obtained previously with the same apparatus, the neutron total cross section has been determined in the resonance region. The resonant structure is found to be quite different from that for the proton. Thereafter the neutron cross section falls off steadily with energy, and the values obtained are consistently lower than those for the proton. Forward scattering amplitudes have been evaluated for the deuteron.}

	abstract = {The unitary isobar model MAID2007 has been developed to analyze the world data of pion photo- and electroproduction. The model contains both a common background and several resonance terms. The background is unitarized according to the K -matrix prescription, and the 13 four-star resonances with masses below 2GeV are described by appropriately unitarized Breit-Wigner forms. The data have been analyzed by both single-energy and global fits, and the transverse and longitudinal helicity amplitudes have been extracted for the four-star resonances below 2GeV. Because of its inherent simplicity, MAID2007 is well adopted for predictions and analysis of the observables in pion photo- and electroproduction.},

@article{Fedorov2020,
	abstract = {A nuclear model is proposed where the nucleons interact by emitting and absorbing mesons, and where the mesons are treated explicitly. A nucleus in this model finds itself in a quantum superposition of states with different number of mesons. Transitions between these states hold the nucleus together. The model---in its simplest incarnation---is applied to the deuteron, where the latter becomes a superposition of a neutron-proton state and a neutron-proton-meson state. Coupling between these states leads to an effective attraction between the nucleons and results in a bound state with negative energy, the deuteron. The model is able to reproduce the accepted values for the binding energy and the charge radius of the deuteron. The model, should it work in practice, has several potential advantages over the existing non-relativistic few-body nuclear models: the reduced number of model parameters, natural inclusion of few-body forces, and natural inclusion of mesonic physics.},

The energy dependence of the s- and p-wave multipoles close to threshold was deduced from a multipole fit and a multipole analysis. The extracted s-wave amplitude E0+ at threshold is found to be significantly smaller than the prediction of the classical low energy theorems, but is in reasonable agreement with the chiral perturbation theory.}

Appl. Math., 2, 164-168 (1944)) and Marquardt (SIAM J. Appl. Math., 11, 431-441 (1963)). The present work discusses a robust and efficient implementation of a version of the Levenberg--Marquardt algorithm and shows that it has strong convergence properties. In addition to robustness, the main features of this implementation are the proper use of implicitly scaled variables and the choice of the Levenberg--Marquardt parameter by means of a scheme due to Hebden (AERE Report TP515). Numerical results illustrating the behavior of this implementation are included. 1 table. (RWR)},
