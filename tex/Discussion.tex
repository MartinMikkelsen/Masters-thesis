\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis, we set out to investigate pion photoproduction in a nuclear model with explicit mesons. To do this we first introduced the model in section \ref{Decsofmodel} and considered how a general system can be investigated. We then focused on the dressing of the proton specifically and introduced a method of solving the wave function numerically. We when exploited the generality of the model to consider different form factors and how this affected the solutions. We also considered a different operator type which is more related to the operator found in effective field theories. This model turned out to be similar but also a lot more intensive numerically.
