This thesis investigates pion photoproduction off nucleons near the threshold using a nuclear model with explicit mesons. In this model, the nucleons do not interact through a potential but emit and absorb mesons which are treated explicitly, and we limit the model to the one meson approximation. We focus on the case where the mesons are pions and calculate
the total cross-section of pion photoproduction near the threshold. Specifically, we find the set of parameters for which the model quantitatively can describe the total cross section near the threshold.
