This thesis investigates pion photoproduction off nucleons near the thresh-
old using a nuclear model with explicit mesons. In this model, the nucle-
ons do not interact through a potential but emit and absorb mesons which
are treated explicitly, and we limit the model to the one meson approxi-
mation. We focus on the case where the mesons are pions and calculate
the total cross-section of pion photoproduction near the threshold. Specifically, we find the set of parameters for which the model quantitatively
can describe the total cross section near the threshold.
